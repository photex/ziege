# Ziege

Ziege manages zig toolchains and zls releases on your system (automatically using a `.zigversion` in your repo root).

It is intended to be used as a proxy over zig itself, but can instead setup symlinks to zig and zls versions in `<repo_root>/tools` instead.

> **Currently, just in a proof-of-concept phase and not ready for general use.**
